# Syncing Database

Each time you make changes to the database in PHPRad or in your database, for instance, you create **new table** or **view**, you **add** or **edit** table fields or properties, these changes have to be implemented in the database- the structures of the database and PHPRad project should be synchronized.

To synchronize database, Click on the **`sync database icon`** to synchronize database structure with your project.

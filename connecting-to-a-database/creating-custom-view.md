# Creating Custom View

## How to create custom view

To create custom view, click on the **`custom view` pane** to highlight -> **right click** on **`custom view`**  and proceed, this allows you to create additional view of the same table or present data in different views.

A pop window appears, where you can **add new data view, build, edit and execute queries**&#x20;

# Authentication

## Configuring user Registration

In order to secure an application, the end-user(s) of the application need to pass through an authentication process. **Click** on the **`Authentication` icon** to start configuration.

From the **drop-down list** on each field, set the **end-user** information detail required for **registration** as preferred

Required **fields** in this section must be completely configured before the **`Login Mode` section** can be active for configuration

## Configuring user login

On the **`Login Mode` section, PHPRad** studio allows it's **user** to specify the method an **end-user of** an **application**  can use to login, such as specifying if an **end- user** can use both **email** and **username**, **username** only or **email** only **** to login, this can be done by using the select **field** provided.

## **Allow User to Register**

This section allows you to set if an **end-user** of the application can self register or not. This is helpful if the application is for management purpose, therefore will not permit **user self-registration**.

**check`Force Email Verification`field** to force a user verify her email after an account has been created **-> check`Auto Login After Registration`** field to automatically **login** an **end-user** of the application once an account has been created successfully **-> check `Enable Password Reset`** field to allow **end-user** recover forgotten password **->click `Okay` -> `Publish`** to view changes.

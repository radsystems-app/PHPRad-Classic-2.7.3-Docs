# Adding Audit Trail Log

This allows users to configure logging for actions(Login, Failed, Delete, Add, Edit and View Actions) taken on the generated app. There are three log locations available, Table, File and Email. You have the option of choosing to log **Login Actions**, **Failed Actions** and **Page Actions**, just by checking and un-checking corresponding check boxes.

## Table
